On an `n x n` chessboard, a knight starts at the cell `(row, column)` and attempts to make exactly `k` moves. The rows and columns are **0-indexed**, so the top-left cell is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right cell is `(n - 1, n - 1)`.

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `k` moves or has moved off the chessboard.

Return *the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 0.06250
Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 1, k = 0, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 1.00000
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 25`
- `0 <= k <= 100`
- `0 <= row, column <= n`

动态规划

定义$ dp[step][i][j] $表示骑士从棋盘上的点 $(i, j)$ 出发，走了$step$ 步时仍然留在棋盘上的概率

特别地，当点 (i, j) 不在棋盘上时，$dp[step][i][j]=0$；当点 (i, j) 在棋盘上且 $step=0$ 时，$dp[step][i][j]=1$。对于其他情况，$\textit{dp}[\textit{step}][i][j] = \dfrac{1}{8} \times \sum\limits_{\textit{di}, \textit{dj}} \textit{dp}[\textit{step}-1][i+\textit{di}][j+\textit{dj}]$

step的概率取决于8个step-1的情况，每种情况都是0或1，做出八分之一的贡献

```java
class Solution {
    static int[][] dirs = {{-2, -1}, {-2, 1}, {2, -1}, {2, 1}, {-1, -2}, {-1, 2}, {1, -2}, {1, 2}};

    public double knightProbability(int n, int k, int row, int column) {
        double[][][] dp = new double[k + 1][n][n];
        for (int step = 0; step <= k; step++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (step == 0) {
                        dp[step][i][j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                            int ni = i + dir[0], nj = j + dir[1];
                            if (ni >= 0 && ni < n && nj >= 0 && nj < n) {
                                dp[step][i][j] += dp[step - 1][ni][nj] / 8;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[k][row][column];
    }
