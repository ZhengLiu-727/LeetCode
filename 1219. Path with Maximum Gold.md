In a gold mine `grid` of size `m x n`, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, `0` if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with `0` gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from **any** position in the grid that has some gold.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 15`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
- There are at most **25** cells containing gold.



> **思路**

回溯法，从每个格子开始dfs，遍历过的就暂时设为0，防止重复访问

每次遍历都更新ans

```java
class Solution {
    int ans=0;
    int grid[][];
    public int getMaximumGold(int[][] grid) {
        this.grid = grid;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    dfs(i, j, 0);
                    }
                }
            }
        return ans;
    }

    public void dfs(int i, int j, int gold) {
        if (i == -1 || j == -1 || i == grid.length || j == grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        int g = grid[i][j];
        gold += g;
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        ans = Math.max(ans,gold);
        dfs(i+1, j, gold);
        dfs(i-1, j, gold);
        dfs(i, j+1, gold);
        dfs(i, j-1, gold);

        grid[i][j] = g;
    }
}
```
