You are given an array of integers `nums`. Perform the following steps:

1. Find **any** two **adjacent** numbers in `nums` that are **non-coprime**.
2. If no such numbers are found, **stop** the process.
3. Otherwise, delete the two numbers and **replace** them with their **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**.
4. **Repeat** this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.

Return *the **final** modified array.* It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to `108`.

Two values `x` and `y` are **non-coprime** if `GCD(x, y) > 1` where `GCD(x, y)` is the **Greatest Common Divisor** of `x` and `y`.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [6,4,3,2,7,6,2]
Output: [12,7,6]
Explanation: 
- (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = [12,3,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = [12,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = [12,7,6,2].
- (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = [12,7,6].
There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
Thus, the final modified array is [12,7,6].
Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3,3]
Output: [2,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3].
- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3].
- (2, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(2, 2) = 2. Now, nums = [2,1,1,3].
There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
Thus, the final modified array is [2,1,1,3].
Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to `10^8`.



> **思路**

使用stack进行模拟，遍历数组，放进去时检查一下能不能和栈顶的元素进行操作

如果互质，那么正常入栈，遍历继续

如果不互质，把栈顶元素pop出来，将当前数字改为lcm，继续检查能不能和栈顶的元素进行操作



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> replaceNonCoprimes(int[] nums) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        stack.push(nums[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int current = nums[i];
            // 每个数放入前需要先和栈内的元素尝试化简
            while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                int last = stack.peek();
                int gcd = gcd(last, current);
                if (gcd > 1) {
                    stack.pop();
                    current = (int)((long) current * last / gcd);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            // 化简完成后再放入栈中
            stack.push(current);
        }
        
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            ans.add(stack.pollLast());
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```
