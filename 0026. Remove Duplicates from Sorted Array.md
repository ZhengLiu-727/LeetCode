Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` *after placing the final result in the first* `k` *slots of* `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.



> **思路**

快慢指针

当快指针和前一个元素不同时，说明遇到了新元素，慢指针移动一次



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2) {
            return nums.length;
        }
        int slow = 1;
        for (int fast = 1; fast < nums.length; fast++) {
            if (nums[fast] != nums[fast - 1]) {
                nums[slow] = nums[fast];
                slow++;
            }
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
```
