Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```java
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 3999`



> **思路**

数字小于等于3999

其实只要思考一些特殊情况就行，什么是特殊情况呢？就是涉及到9和4的就是特殊情况。

因为大部分情况，比如 30，就是 3 个 10 的连续组合，130就是现减掉一个100，然后再拼上30

但涉及到 4 和 9 的时候他们并不是 4 个什么或者 9 个什么的连续组合，而是大数 - 1，所以我们就把他们当成一种特殊的数字，单独来处理

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        int values[] = {1000,900,500,400,100,90,50,40,10,9,5,4,1};
        String reps[] = {"M","CM","D","CD","C","XC","L","XL","X","IX","V","IV","I"};
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < 13; i++) {
            while (num >= values[i]) {
                num -= values[i];
                sb.append(reps[i]);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
