A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Example 1:**

![](https://typora-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/robot_maze.png)

```java
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

**Example 4:**

```java
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10 ^ 9`.

```java
class Solution {
  public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
      
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
          dp[i][j] = 1;
        } else {
          dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        }
      }
    }

    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
  }
}
```
