Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1`



> **思路**

贪心算法，要满足最多的孩子，就要让饼干刚刚好满足这个孩子的需求，不能超过太多，否则就浪费了

所以将饼干和孩子都进行排序，如果当前这个饼干大于等于孩子需求，那么两个指针都+1，如果小于，说明当前这个饼干没有用（因为这个饼干能满足的孩子已经都被满足了，剩下食量大的它也满足不了），孩子的指针不动（等待更大的饼干），饼干的指针+1



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int child = 0;
        int cookie = 0;
        Arrays.sort(g);  
        Arrays.sort(s);
        while (child < g.length && cookie < s.length) { 
            if (g[child] <= s[cookie]) { 
                child++;
            }
            cookie++; 
        }
        return child; 
    }
}
```
