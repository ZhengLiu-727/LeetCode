You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the `ith` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the `1st` place athlete has the highest score, the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

- The `1st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
- The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
- The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
- For the `4th` place to the `nth` place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `xth` place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the **rank** of the `ith` athlete.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == score.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= score[i] <= 106`
- All the values in `score` are **unique**.

> **思路**

使用HashMap记录原来各个元素对应的坐标，然后进行排序，在依次填到答案数组中

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public String[] findRelativeRanks(int[] score) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    int n = score.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      map.put(score[i], i);
    }
    Arrays.sort(score);
    String[] res = new String[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int s = map.get(score[i]);
      if (i == n-1) res[s] = "Gold Medal";
      else if (i == n-2) res[s] = "Silver Medal";
      else if (i == n-3) res[s] = "Bronze Medal";
      else res[s] = String.valueOf(n - i);
    }
    return res;
  }
}
```
