A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting true and `'F'` denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by **maximizing** the number of **consecutive** questions with the **same** answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `ith` question. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:

- Change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'` (i.e., set `answerKey[i]` to `'T'` or `'F'`).

Return *the **maximum** number of consecutive* `'T'`s or `'F'`s *in the answer key after performing the operation at most* `k` *times*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = "TTTT".
There are four consecutive 'T's.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "FFFT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "TFFF".
In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT"
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT". 
In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == answerKey.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` or `'F'`
- `1 <= k <= n`



> **思路**

最多可以改变k个字符，那么我们就分别计算连续的T和连续的F，然后去个最大值就行

求字符串中连续的字符，滑动窗口，遇到不同的字符就变，同时count++记录变的次数，当count大于k时，就要滑动左边界，直到count == k



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutiveAnswers(String answerKey, int k) {
        return Math.max(maxConsecutiveChar(answerKey, k, 'T'), maxConsecutiveChar(answerKey, k, 'F'));
    }

    public int maxConsecutiveChar(String answerKey, int k, char ch) {
        int n = answerKey.length();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int left = 0, right = 0, sum = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += answerKey.charAt(right) != ch ? 1 : 0;
            while (sum > k) {
                sum -= answerKey.charAt(left++) != ch ? 1 : 0;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
