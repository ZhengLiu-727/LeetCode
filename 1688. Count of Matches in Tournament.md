ou are given an integer `n`, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

- If the current number of teams is **even**, each team gets paired with another team. A total of `n / 2` matches are played, and `n / 2` teams advance to the next round.
- If the current number of teams is **odd**, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance to the next round.

Return *the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.*

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: Details of the tournament: 
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 14
Output: 13
Explanation: Details of the tournament:
- 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`



> **思路**

思路比较简单，就是模拟整个过程



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        while (n != 1) {
            res += n / 2;
            n = (n + 1) / 2;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
