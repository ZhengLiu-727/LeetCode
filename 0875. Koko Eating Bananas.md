Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return *the minimum integer* `k` *such that she can eat all the bananas within* `h` *hours*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
- `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`



> **思路**

二分法，left是1，right是数组中的最大值

辅助函数判断当前这个进食速度，能否在规定时间内吃完



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = 1;
        for (int pile : piles) {
            right = Math.max(right, pile);
        }
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (check(piles, mid, h)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }

    public boolean check(int[] piles, int mid, int h) {
        int time = 0;
        for (int pile: piles) {
            time += (pile - 1) / mid + 1;
        }
        return time <= h;
    }
}
```

**时间复杂度：** $ O(N log M) $，N为数组长度，M为数组中最大值

**空间复杂度：** $ O(1) $
