ou are given two integer arrays `persons` and `times`. In an election, the `ith` vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time `times[i]`.

For each query at a time `t`, find the person that was leading the election at time `t`. Votes cast at time `t` will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Implement the `TopVotedCandidate` class:

- `TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)` Initializes the object with the `persons` and `times` arrays.
- `int q(int t)` Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t` according to the mentioned rules.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input
["TopVotedCandidate", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q"]
[[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]], [3], [12], [25], [15], [24], [8]]
Output
[null, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TopVotedCandidate topVotedCandidate = new TopVotedCandidate([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]);
topVotedCandidate.q(3); // return 0, At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(12); // return 1, At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(25); // return 1, At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
topVotedCandidate.q(15); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(24); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(8); // return 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= persons.length <= 5000`
- `times.length == persons.length`
- `0 <= persons[i] < persons.length`
- `0 <= times[i] <= 109`
- `times` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- `times[0] <= t <= 109`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `q`.

> **思路**

使用一个队列，记录在times数组每个节点，也就是每次投票时，票数最多的人。构建一个map，记录所有人的票数，每次投票时+1，同时和之前票数最多的人进行比较，如果大于等于就更新票数最多的人，然后将票数最多的人加入队列

查询时使用二分法，找到times数组中小于等于查询时刻的最大值

> **解法**

```java
class TopVotedCandidate {
  int[] times;
  List<Integer> tops;
  Map<Integer, Integer> count;

  public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
    this.times = times;
    this.tops = new ArrayList<>();
    this.count = new HashMap<>();
    count.put(-1, -1);
    int top = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
      int p = persons[i];
      count.put(p, count.getOrDefault(p, 0) + 1);
      if (count.get(p) >= count.get(top)) {
        top = p;
      }
      tops.add(top);
    }
  }
  
  public int q(int t) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = times.length;
    while (i < j) {
      int mid = (i + j) / 2;
      if (times[mid] > t) {
        j = mid;
      } else {
        i = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    return tops.get(i - 1);
  }
}

/**
 * Your TopVotedCandidate object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TopVotedCandidate obj = new TopVotedCandidate(persons, times);
 * int param_1 = obj.q(t);
