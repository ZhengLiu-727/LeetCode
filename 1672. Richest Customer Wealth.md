You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `ith` customer has in the `jth` bank. Return *the **wealth** that the richest customer has.*

A customer's **wealth** is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum **wealth**.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == accounts.length`
- `n == accounts[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100`

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length ; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                sum += accounts[i][j];
            }
            max = Math.max(sum, max);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
