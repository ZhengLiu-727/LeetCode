You are given an array `points`, an integer `angle`, and your `location`, where `location = [posx, posy]` and `points[i] = [xi, yi]` both denote **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You **cannot move** from your position, but you can **rotate**. In other words, `posx` and `posy` cannot be changed. Your field of view in **degrees** is represented by `angle`, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let `d` be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the **inclusive** range of angles `[d - angle/2, d + angle/2]`.



You can **see** some set of points if, for each point, the **angle** formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is **in your field of view**.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.

Return *the maximum number of points you can see*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is in front and in the same line of sight.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: All points can be made visible in your field of view, including the one at your location.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/30/5010bfd3-86e6-465f-ac64-e9df941d2e49.png)

```java
Input: points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `location.length == 2`
- `0 <= angle < 360`
- `0 <= posx, posy, xi, yi <= 100`

> **思路**

思路不复杂，细节很多。

首先就是求极坐标的角度，用`Math.atan2(y, x) ` 范围为从 -pi 到 pi。

然后加入到队列中进行排序，加入的时候将角度转化为-180到180。

然后有了排序好的队列就可以进行滑动窗口了，但是要注意一四象限在队列中分别处在头和尾，无法统计，这时候，要把所有的角度加上360，加入到队列的末尾，相当于把一四象限连接起来了

同时也要注意统计和观察位置重合的坐标点，单独加上

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int visiblePoints(List<List<Integer>> points, int angle, List<Integer> location) {
        List<Double> angles = new ArrayList<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (List<Integer> p : points) {
            int dx = p.get(0) - location.get(0);
            int dy = p.get(1) - location.get(1);
            if (dx == 0 && dy == 0) { // edge case of same point
                count++;
                continue;
            } 
            angles.add(Math.atan2(dy, dx) * (180 / Math.PI));
        }
        Collections.sort(angles);
        List<Double> tmp = new ArrayList<>(angles);
        for (double d : angles) tmp.add(d + 360); // concatenate to handle edge case
        int res = count;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < tmp.size(); i++) {
            while (tmp.get(i) - tmp.get(j) > angle) {
                j++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, count + i - j + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
