You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return *the hint for your friend's guess*.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB"`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: secret = "1", guess = "0"
Output: "0A0B"
```

**Example 4:**

```java
Input: secret = "1", guess = "1"
Output: "1A0B"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
- `secret.length == guess.length`
- `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

> **思路**

遍历字符串，如果同位置的字符相等，那么 A 就 + 1，如果不相等，就分别记录在两个数组中。

B 等于两个数组中小的之和

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
    int n = secret.length();
    int[] secretArray = new int[10];
    int[] guessArray = new int[10];

    int numA = 0;
    int numB = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (guess.charAt(i) == secret.charAt(i)) {
        numA++;
      } else {
        secretArray[secret.charAt(i) - '0'] ++;
        guessArray[guess.charAt(i) - '0']++;
      }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      numB += Math.min(secretArray[i], guessArray[i]);
    }

    return numA + "A" + numB + "B";
  }
}
```
