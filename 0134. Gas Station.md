There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return *the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return* `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `gas.length == n`
- `cost.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4`



> **思路**

第一种思路：遍历

既然答案只有一种，那么就尝试从每个点开始，看看能不能绕一圈

```java
public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
    int n = gas.length;
    //考虑从每一个点出发
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int j = i;
        int remain = gas[i];
        //当前剩余的油能否到达下一个点
        while (remain - cost[j] >= 0) {
            //减去花费的加上新的点的补给
            remain = remain - cost[j] + gas[(j + 1) % n];
            j = (j + 1) % n;
            //j 回到了 i
            if (j == i) {
                return i;
            }
        }
    }
    //任何点都不可以
    return -1;
}
```



这种方法其实有些重复计算，假设从 x 点出发，发现无法到达 y+1 点，也就是说只能到达 y 点，那么从 `[x+1, y]` 中间这些点开始都无法到达 y+1 点，因为从 x 点到达这个区间内的中间节点时可能会剩一些油，剩油都到不了 y+1，那么空油箱开始更到不了，所以如果当从 x 点出发结束后，直接跳到 y+1 点继续

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n = gas.length;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            int sumOfGas = 0, sumOfCost = 0;
            int cnt = 0; //统计访问过几个加油站
            while (cnt < n) {
                int j = (i + cnt) % n;
                sumOfGas += gas[j];
                sumOfCost += cost[j];
                if (sumOfCost > sumOfGas) {
                    break;
                }
                cnt++;
            }
            if (cnt == n) {
                return i;
            } else {
                i = i + cnt + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int len = gas.length;
        int spare = 0;
        int minSpare = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            spare += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (spare < minSpare) {
                minSpare = spare;
                minIndex = i;
            }
        }

        return spare < 0 ? -1 : (minIndex + 1) % len;
    }
}
