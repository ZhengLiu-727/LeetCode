Given a string `s` containing only lowercase English letters and the `'?'` character, convert **all** the `'?'` characters into lowercase letters such that the final string does not contain any **consecutive repeating** characters. You **cannot** modify the non `'?'` characters.

It is **guaranteed** that there are no consecutive repeating characters in the given string **except** for `'?'`.

Return *the final string after all the conversions (possibly zero) have been made*. If there is more than one solution, return **any of them**. It can be shown that an answer is always possible with the given constraints.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "?zs"
Output: "azs"
Explanation: There are 25 solutions for this problem. From "azs" to "yzs", all are valid. Only "z" is an invalid modification as the string will consist of consecutive repeating characters in "zzs".
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "ubv?w"
Output: "ubvaw"
Explanation: There are 24 solutions for this problem. Only "v" and "w" are invalid modifications as the strings will consist of consecutive repeating characters in "ubvvw" and "ubvww".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consist of lowercase English letters and `'?'`.



> **思路**

就是在遇到括号是看一下前面和后面的字符，从a开始加，直到不重复。注意第一个字符和最后一个字符corner case



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public String modifyString(String s) {
        int n= s.length();
        char[] sb = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i)=='?') {
                char change='a';
                while ((i > 0 && sb[i-1] == change) || (i < n-1 && sb[i+1] == change)) {
                    change++;
                }
                sb[i]=change;
            }
        }
        return new String(sb);
    }
}
```
