There is an exam room with `n` seats in a single row labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number. If no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number `0`.

Design a class that simulates the mentioned exam room.

Implement the `ExamRoom` class:

- `ExamRoom(int n)` Initializes the object of the exam room with the number of the seats `n`.
- `int seat()` Returns the label of the seat at which the next student will set.
- `void leave(int p)` Indicates that the student sitting at seat `p` will leave the room. It is guaranteed that there will be a student sitting at seat `p`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["ExamRoom", "seat", "seat", "seat", "seat", "leave", "seat"]
[[10], [], [], [], [], [4], []]
Output
[null, 0, 9, 4, 2, null, 5]

Explanation
ExamRoom examRoom = new ExamRoom(10);
examRoom.seat(); // return 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
examRoom.seat(); // return 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
examRoom.seat(); // return 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
examRoom.seat(); // return 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
examRoom.leave(4);
examRoom.seat(); // return 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- It is guaranteed that there is a student sitting at seat `p`.
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `seat` and `leave`.



> **思路**

我们可以用有序集合存储目前有学生的座位编号。

当我们要调用 leave(p) 函数时，我们只需要把有序集合中的 p 移除即可。

当我们要调用 seat() 函数时，我们遍历这个有序集合，对于相邻的两个座位 i 和 j，如果选择在这两个座位之间入座，那么最近的距离 d 为 (j - i) / 2，选择的座位为 i + d。除此之外，我们还需要考虑坐在最左侧 0 和最右侧 N - 1 的情况。



> **解法**

```java
class ExamRoom {
    int N;
    TreeSet<Integer> students;

    public ExamRoom(int N) {
        this.N = N;
        students = new TreeSet();
    }
    
    public int seat() {
        int ans = 0;
        if (students.size() > 0) {
            // 这个是考虑最左侧0的位置
            int dist = students.first();
            Integer prev = null;

            // 这个for循环中只能检测first和last之间的空位
            for (Integer cur : students) {
                if (prev != null) {
                    int d = (cur - prev) / 2;
                    if (d > dist) {
                        dist = d;
                        ans = prev + d;
                    }
                }
                prev = cur;
            }
            // 如果最后一个位置之后有空位，我们还需要考虑最右侧
            if (N - 1 - students.last() > dist)
                ans = N - 1;
        }

        students.add(ans);
        return ans;
    }

    public void leave(int p) {
        students.remove(p);
    }
}
