You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` specialty retail stores. There are `m` product types of varying amounts, which are given as a **0-indexed** integer array `quantities`, where `quantities[i]` represents the number of products of the `ith` product type.

You need to distribute **all products** to the retail stores following these rules:

- A store can only be given **at most one product type** but can be given **any** amount of it.
- After distribution, each store will be given some number of products (possibly `0`). Let `x` represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want `x` to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to **minimize** the **maximum** number of products that are given to any store.

Return *the minimum possible* `x`.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: One optimal way is:
- The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
- The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 7, quantities = [15,10,10]
Output: 5
Explanation: One optimal way is:
- The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5
- The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
- The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: n = 1, quantities = [100000]
Output: 100000
Explanation: The only optimal way is:
- The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == quantities.length`
- `1 <= m <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= quantities[i] <= 10 ^ 5`

> **思路**

这道题和875，1231，1283很像，都是二分法的思路

left 是 1， right 应该是 max（quantities[i])，这里直接用的上限为100000，区别不大

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public int minimizedMaximum(int n, int[] quantities) {
    int left = 1, right = 100000;
    while (left < right) {
      int mid = (left + right) / 2;
      int sum = 0;
      for (int q : quantities) {
        sum += (q + mid - 1) / mid;
      }
          
      if (sum > n)
          left = mid + 1;
      else
          right = mid;
    }
    return left;
  }
}
```
