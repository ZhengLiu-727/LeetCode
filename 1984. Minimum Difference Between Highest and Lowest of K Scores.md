You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return *the **minimum** possible difference*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`



> **思路**

因为要求分数差值最小，那么这一定是一个连续的分数段，比如1357，取两个，一定是12 35 57这样，而不是17

所以可以先排序，然后滑动窗口



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i + k - 1 < nums.length; i++) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
