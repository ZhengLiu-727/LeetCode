You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is **lonely** when it appears only **once**, and no **adjacent** numbers (i.e. `x + 1` and `x - 1)` appear in the array.

Return ***all** lonely numbers in* `nums`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10,8]
Explanation: 
- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.
- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.
Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].
Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,3,5,3]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: 
- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.
- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.
Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5].
Note that [5, 1] may also be returned.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`



> **思路**

使用HashMap统计频率，如果一个数字的频率大于1，或者map中有其相邻数字，那么就不是我们需要的答案



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findLonely(int[] nums) {
        // 统计数字出现次数
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int key : map.keySet()) {
            // 检测是否满足条件
            if (map.get(key) == 1 && !map.containsKey(key - 1) && !map.containsKey(key + 1)) {
                res.add(key);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
