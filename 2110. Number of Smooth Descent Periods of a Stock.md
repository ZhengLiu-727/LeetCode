You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the `ith` day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is **lower** than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return *the number of **smooth descent periods***.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 ≠ 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `1 <= prices[i] <= 105`

> **思路**

用一个stack去维护平滑递减的序列，如果遇到不平滑递减的情况，就先计算组合，然后清空stack

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public long getDescentPeriods(int[] prices) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() - prices[i] != 1) {
                long len = stack.size();
                res += (1 + len) * len / 2;
                while (stack.size() > 0) stack.poll();
            }
            stack.push(prices[i]);
        }
        long len = stack.size();
        res += (1 + len) * len / 2;
        return res;
    }
}
```
