You are given an integer matrix `isWater` of size `m x n` that represents a map of **land** and **water** cells.

- If `isWater[i][j] == 0`, cell `(i, j)` is a **land** cell.
- If `isWater[i][j] == 1`, cell `(i, j)` is a **water** cell.

You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:

- The height of each cell must be non-negative.
- If the cell is a **water** cell, its height must be `0`.
- Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of **at most** `1`. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is **maximized**.

Return *an integer matrix* `height` *of size* `m x n` *where* `height[i][j]` *is cell* `(i, j)`*'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return **any** of them*.

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-82045-am.png)**

```java
Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-82050-am.png)**

```java
Input: isWater = [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,2,2]]
Explanation: A height of 2 is the maximum possible height of any assignment.
Any height assignment that has a maximum height of 2 while still meeting the rules will also be accepted.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == isWater.length`
- `n == isWater[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `isWater[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- There is at least **one** water cell.



> **思路**

BFS，先将所有的水域加入到queue中，然后逐个弹出，搜索水域上下左右的四个区域，如果还没被访问过，就+1，并且加入到queue中



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] highestPeak(int[][] isWater) {
        int m = isWater.length;
        int n = isWater[0].length;
        int[][] ans = new int[m][n];
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (isWater[i][j] == 1) q.offer(new int[]{i, j});
                ans[i][j] = isWater[i][j] == 1 ? 0 : -1;
            }
        }
        int[][] dirs = new int[][]{{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] info = q.poll();
            int x = info[0], y = info[1];
            for (int[] d : dirs) {
                int nx = x + d[0], ny = y + d[1];
                if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n) continue;
                if (ans[nx][ny] != -1) continue;
                ans[nx][ny] = ans[x][y] + 1;
                q.offer(new int[]{nx, ny});
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
