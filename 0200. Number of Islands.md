Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

> **解法：DFS**

```java
class Solution {
    private int n;
    private int m;
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        n = grid.length;
        m = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= n || j < 0 || j >= m || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i-1, j);
        dfs(grid, i+1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j-1);
        dfs(grid, i, j+1);
    }
}
```
