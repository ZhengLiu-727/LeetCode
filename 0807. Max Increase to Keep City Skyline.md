There is a city composed of `n x n` blocks, where each block contains a single building shaped like a vertical square prism. You are given a **0-indexed** `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where `grid[r][c]` represents the **height** of the building located in the block at row `r` and column `c`.

A city's **skyline** is the the outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. The **skyline** from each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.

We are allowed to increase the height of **any number of buildings by any amount** (the amount can be different per building). The height of a `0`-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building should **not** affect the city's **skyline** from any cardinal direction.

Return *the **maximum total sum** that the height of the buildings can be increased by **without** changing the city's **skyline** from any cardinal direction*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/21/807-ex1.png)

```java
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
Explanation: The building heights are shown in the center of the above image.
The skylines when viewed from each cardinal direction are drawn in red.
The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:
gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Increasing the height of any building will result in the skyline changing.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[r].length`
- `2 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[r][c] <= 100`

> **思路**

如果不想破坏天际线，就要是当前建筑从四个方向上不能超过最高建筑，所以应该先找到各个角度的最高建筑

因为南北和东西方向对称，所以需要建立两个数组，记录前后 和 左右高度最高的建筑高度。然后再次遍历矩阵，如果当前建筑高度小于两个方向的最高高度，就可以增加高度

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(int[][] grid) {
    int n = grid.length;
    int[] rowMax = new int[n];
    int[] colMax = new int[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0;j < n; j++) {
        rowMax[i] = Math.max(rowMax[i], grid[i][j]);
        colMax[j] = Math.max(colMax[j], grid[i][j]);
      }
    }
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        int cur = grid[i][j];
        res += Math.min(rowMax[i] - cur, colMax[j] - cur);
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
}
```
