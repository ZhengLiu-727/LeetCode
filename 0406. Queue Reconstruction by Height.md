You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with **exactly** `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return *the queue that is represented by the input array* `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= people.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= hi <= 106`
- `0 <= ki < people.length`
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

> **思路**

对数组进行排序，首先对身高进行降序排序，如果身高相同，对k进行升序排序

然后将排序好的数组，依次放入ArrayList中，index就是k，这个需要用`add(int index, E Element)`

如果当前index没有数组，就把数组放在这，如果有，就会把已经防止好的向后挤

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
    Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> {
      if (a[0] != b[0]) return b[0] - a[0];
      return a[1] - b[1];
    });
    
    List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<int[]>();
    for (int[] person : people) {
      ans.add(person[1], person);
    }
    return ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][]);
  }
}
```
