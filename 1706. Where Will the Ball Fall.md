You have a 2-D `grid` of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

- A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as `1`.
- A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as `-1`.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return *an array* `answer` *of size* `n` *where* `answer[i]` *is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the* `ith` *column at the top, or `-1` \*if the ball gets stuck in the box\*.*

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/26/ball.jpg)**

```java
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: This example is shown in the photo.
Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: The ball gets stuck against the left wall.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,-1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `1` or `-1`.



> **思路**

模拟小球下落的过程，对于每个小球，它的下一个位置：

`next_row = curr_row + 1`, `next_col = current_col + grid[curr_row][curr_col]`

有两种-1的情况：

- 到达了边界，`next_col < 0 || next_col == n`
- 形成了夹角，`grid[curr_row][curr_col] != grid[curr_row][next_col]` ，就是说使用当前这个格子能计算出下一层是向左走还是向右走，但是能否下去，还要看左边或者右边的格子是否会挡住自己



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findBall(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(ans, -1);
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int col = j;  // 球的初始列
            for (int[] row : grid) {
                int dir = row[col];
                col += dir;  // 移动球
                if (col < 0 || col == n || row[col] != dir) {  // 到达侧边或 V 形
                    col = -1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (col >= 0) {  // 成功到达底部
                ans[j] = col;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
