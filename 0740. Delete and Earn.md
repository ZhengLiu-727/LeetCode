You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.

Return *the **maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`



> **思路**

这道题和经典的打家劫舍比较像

也是如果获得了某一个，就不能获得其两侧的，只不过这道题同一个数可能会出现很多次。我们需要现预处理一下，知道每个数的总和，然后从小到大遍历即可。



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        int max = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();
        int[] sum = new int[max + 1];
        for(int num : nums) {
            sum[num] += num;
        }

        int first = sum[0];
        int second = Math.max(sum[0],sum[1]);
        for(int i = 2; i <= max; i++) {
            int temp = second;
            second = Math.max(second, first+sum[i]);
            first = temp;
        }
        return second;
    }
}
```
