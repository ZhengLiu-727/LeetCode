Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.

- For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should **reverse** the segment that starts at `0` and ends at `3` (**inclusive**). The resulting string will be `"dcbaefd"`.

Return *the resulting string*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 250`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `ch` is a lowercase English letter.



> **思路**

indexOf 能找到第一个字符的index，如果没找到就直接返回，如果找到了，就使用StringBuilder把前半个字符串reverse



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        int index = word.indexOf(ch);
        if (index < 0) {
            return word;
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(word.substring(0, index + 1));
        sb.reverse().append(word.substring(index + 1));
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
