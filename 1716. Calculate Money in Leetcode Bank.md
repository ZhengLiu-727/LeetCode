Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the **previous Monday**.

Given `n`, return *the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the* `nth` *day.*

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`



> **思路**

对存钱过程进行模拟，计算出日期和周数

还可以用数学计算直接求结果，因为每周都增加7，所以是一个等差数列



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res += (i-1) % 7 + (i-1) / 7 + 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**时间复杂度：**$ O(N) $

**空间复杂度：**$ O(1) $



```java
class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        // 所有完整的周存的钱
        int weekNumber = n / 7;
        int firstWeekMoney = (1 + 7) * 7 / 2;
        int lastWeekMoney = firstWeekMoney + 7 * (weekNumber - 1);
        int weekMoney = (firstWeekMoney + lastWeekMoney) * weekNumber / 2;
        // 剩下的不能构成一个完整的周的天数里存的钱
        int dayNumber = n % 7;
        int firstDayMoney = 1 + weekNumber;
        int lastDayMoney = firstDayMoney + dayNumber - 1;
        int dayMoney = (firstDayMoney + lastDayMoney) * dayNumber / 2;
        return weekMoney + dayMoney;
    }
}
```
