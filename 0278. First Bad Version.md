You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

这道题是二分法套了层皮，其实就是寻找左侧边界。

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
