You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attacki, defensei]` represents the properties of the `ith` character in the game.

A character is said to be **weak** if any other character has **both** attack and defense levels **strictly greater** than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is said to be **weak** if there exists another character `j` where `attackj > attacki` and `defensej > defensei`.

Return *the number of **weak** characters*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= properties.length <= 10^5`
- `properties[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= attacki, defensei <= 10^5`



> **思路**

这道题和354有点像，都是二维排序

排序，按攻击力从大到小排序，如果攻击力相同，按防御力从小到大排序

排序后遍历数组，维护最大的防御值，如果这样最大的防御值比当前的防御值大，那么当前元素一定为弱角色

因为同攻击力时，防御力是升序，所以不存在同攻击，前者防御力 大于 后者这种情况



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        Arrays.sort(properties,(o1,o2) -> o1[0]==o2[0] ? o1[1]-o2[1] : o2[0]-o1[0]);
        int count = 0;
        int max = -1;
        int n = properties.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (max > properties[i][1]) {
                count++;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, properties[i][1]);
            
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
