A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array `stations` where `stations[i] = [positioni, fueli]` indicates that the `ith` gas station is `positioni` miles east of the starting position and has `fueli` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

Return *the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination*. If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with `0` fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with `0` fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel.
We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.
Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach the target.
We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= target, startFuel <= 10^9`
- `0 <= stations.length <= 500`
- `1 <= positioni < positioni+1 < target`
- `1 <= fueli < 10^9`



> **思路**

贪心。

这个题我们要把加油站看作一个油桶，我们路过时就把这个油桶装在车上，至于加不加，看后面情况。

当我们需要加油时，也就意味着我们此时剩余的油跑不到终点，也跑不到下一个加油站。我们就需要拿出我们之前收集的油桶中最大的一个，加油。

```java
class Solution {
    public int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, int[][] stations) {
        if (stations.length == 0) {
            return startFuel < target ? -1 : 0;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        // 这个sum是总可行驶里程的意思（相当于当前位置+当前油量）
        int sum = startFuel;
        int index = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> b-a);
        while (sum < target) {
            // 把当前范围能加的油桶都装上
            while (index < stations.length) {
                int nextPos = stations[index][0];
                int nextFuel = stations[index][1];
                // 如果能到达下一个加油站，就装上油桶，否则就得先加油
                if (sum >= nextPos) {
                    pq.offer(nextFuel);
                    index++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }

            // 需要加上一桶油，才能继续走
            if (pq.isEmpty()) {
                return -1;
            } else {
                sum += pq.poll();
                ans++;
            }
        }
            

        return ans;
    }
}
```
