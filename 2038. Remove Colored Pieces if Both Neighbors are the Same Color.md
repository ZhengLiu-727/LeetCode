There are `n` pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by `'A'` or by `'B'`. You are given a string `colors` of length `n` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` piece.

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take **alternating turns** removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves **first**.

- Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored `'A'` if **both its neighbors** are also colored `'A'`. She is **not allowed** to remove pieces that are colored `'B'`.
- Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored `'B'` if **both its neighbors** are also colored `'B'`. He is **not allowed** to remove pieces that are colored `'A'`.
- Alice and Bob **cannot** remove pieces from the edge of the line.
- If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player **loses** and the other player **wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` *if Alice wins, or return* `false` *if Bob wins*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: colors = "AAABABB"
Output: true
Explanation:
AAABABB -> AABABB
Alice moves first.
She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

Now it's Bob's turn.
Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.
Thus, Alice wins, so return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: colors = "AA"
Output: false
Explanation:
Alice has her turn first.
There are only two 'A's and both are on the edge of the line, so she cannot move on her turn.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: colors = "ABBBBBBBAAA"
Output: false
Explanation:
ABBBBBBBAAA -> ABBBBBBBAA
Alice moves first.
Her only option is to remove the second to last 'A' from the right.

ABBBBBBBAA -> ABBBBBBAA
Next is Bob's turn.
He has many options for which 'B' piece to remove. He can pick any.

On Alice's second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= colors.length <= 10^5`
- `colors` consists of only the letters `'A'` and `'B'`



> **思路**

这道题看起来像是博弈论，很复杂。但其实不难，因为Alice的操作并不会影响bob的操作的可能性，比如AAABBBAAA，Alice怎么操作不会影响bob只能取一次，而bob的操作也不会影响Alice，所以这道题其实就是寻找有多少个三连。如果Alice的三连多，那么她取胜。



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean winnerOfGame(String colors) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < colors.length() - 2; i++){
            if(colors.substring(i,i+3).equals("AAA")) sum++;
            if(colors.substring(i,i+3).equals("BBB")) sum--;
        }

        return sum > 0;
    }
}
```
