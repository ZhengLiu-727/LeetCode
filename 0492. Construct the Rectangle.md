A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width `W` should not be larger than the length `L`, which means `L >= W`.
3. The difference between length `L` and width `W` should be as small as possible.

Return *an array `[L, W]` where `L` and `W` are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.*

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: area = 4
Output: [2,2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= area <= 107`

> **思路**

easy题，先用sqrt找到平方根，然后判断是否能整除

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
    int width = (int)Math.sqrt(area);
    while (area % width != 0) {
      width--;
    }
    return new int[]{area / width, width};
  }
}
```
