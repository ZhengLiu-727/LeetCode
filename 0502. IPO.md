Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return *the final maximized capital*.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
- `0 <= w <= 10^9`
- `n == profits.length`
- `n == capital.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= profits[i] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= capital[i] <= 10^9`



> **思路**

这个题题意还是比较好理解的，思路主要是贪心+排序

我们在能力范围内（也就是那个w），肯定要选利润最高的。但是每做完一个任务，我们的w都会变化。

所以我们使用大根堆，来选出利润最高的任务。然后把所有的任务逐步加入到堆中，每次只加我们能够选择的，也就是成本小于等于w的。

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        int n = profits.length;
        int index = 0;
        int[][] arr = new int[n][2];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            arr[i][0] = capital[i];
            arr[i][1] = profits[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> y - x);
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            while (index < n && arr[index][0] <= w) {
                pq.add(arr[index][1]);
                index++;
            }
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                w += pq.poll();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        return w;
    }
}
