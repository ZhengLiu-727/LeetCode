You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions **in order** (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. Solving question `i` will **earn** you `pointsi` points but you will be **unable** to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions. If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

- For example, given`questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]`:

  - If question `0` is solved, you will earn `3` points but you will be unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
  - If instead, question `0` is skipped and question `1` is solved, you will earn `4` points but you will be unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.

Return *the **maximum** points you can earn for the exam*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.
- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2
- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points
Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 1 and 4.
- Skip question 0
- Solve question 1: Earn 2 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 2 and 3
- Solve question 4: Earn 5 points
Total points earned: 2 + 5 = 7. There is no other way to earn 7 or more points.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= questions.length <= 10^5`
- `questions[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 10^5`



> **思路**

dp的思路，dp[i] 为第 i 题时最大的分数，如果不做题，那么`dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]);`

如果做题，那么可以直接更新若干题后的分数

比如说第一天的分数是2，但是做了需要休息两天，那么直接更新第四天的分数，因为第二第三天的分数不可能比第一天多



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    
    public long mostPoints(int[][] questions) {
        int len = questions.length;
        long[] dp = new long[len+1];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            // 不做题
            dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i + 1]);
            // 做题
            int next = Math.min(i + 1 + questions[i][1], len);
            dp[next] = Math.max(dp[next], dp[i] + questions[i][0]);
        }
        return dp[len];
    }
}
```
