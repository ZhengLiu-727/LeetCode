You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array `sweetness`.

You want to share the chocolate with your `k` friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into `k + 1` pieces using `k` cuts, each piece consists of some **consecutive** chunks.

Being generous, you will eat the piece with the **minimum total sweetness** and give the other pieces to your friends.

Find the **maximum total sweetness** of the piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.



**Example 1:**

```java
Input: sweetness = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,3], [4,5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: sweetness = [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], k = 8
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to cut the bar into 9 pieces.
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: sweetness = [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,2], [1,2,2], [1,2,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k < sweetness.length <= 104`
- `1 <= sweetness[i] <= 105`



> **思路**





> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
  public int maximizeSweetness(int[] sweetness, int k) {
    int left = 1, right = (int)1e9 / (k + 1);
    while (left < right) {
      int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
      int cur = 0, cuts = 0;
      for (int a : sweetness) {
        if ((cur += a) >= mid) {
          cur = 0;
          if (++cuts > k) break;
        }
      }
      if (cuts > k) {
        left = mid;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    return left;
  }
}
```
