You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` is **preserved**.
3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return *the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `nums.length` is **even**
- `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 10^5`
- `nums` consists of **equal** number of positive and negative integers.



> **思路**

给正数和负数分别设置一个指针，然后遍历数组，分布放入对应的指针位置，指针位置向右移动两格



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] res = new int[nums.length];
        int posIndex = 0;
        int negIndex = 1;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                res[posIndex] = num;
                posIndex += 2;
            } else {
                res[negIndex] = num;
                negIndex += 2;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
