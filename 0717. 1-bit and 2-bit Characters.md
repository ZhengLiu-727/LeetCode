We have two special characters:

- The first character can be represented by one bit `0`.
- The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Given a binary array `bits` that ends with `0`, return `true` if the last character must be a one-bit character.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bits.length <= 1000`
- `bits[i]` is either `0` or `1`.



> **思路**

从左到右开始遍历，如果当前位置是1，那么这个1一定会“吃掉”后面的一位数字，如果当前位置是0，那么这个0本身就是一个special character。到最后看是不是只剩1位数



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int start = 0 ;
        while(start<bits.length-1){
            if(bits[start] == 0){
                start++;
            }else{
                start+=2;
            }
        }
        return start == bits.length-1;
    }
}
```
