Given two strings `a` and `b`, return *the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between* `a` *and* `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return `-1`.

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a **subsequence of one but not the other**.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`.

- For example, `"abc"` is a subsequence of `"aebdc"` because you can delete the underlined characters in `"aebdc"` to get `"abc"`. Other subsequences of `"aebdc"` include `"aebdc"`, `"aeb"`, and `""` (empty string).

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
- `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.



> **思路**

这就是个脑筋急转弯

字符串的子序列的长度不会超过该字符串的长度。若子序列的长度等于字符串的长度，那么子序列就是该字符串。

若两字符串不相同，那么我们可以选择较长的字符串作为最长特殊序列，显然它不会是较短的字符串的子序列。特别地，当两字符串长度相同时（但不是同一字符串），我们仍然可以选择其中的一个字符串作为最长特殊序列，它不会是另一个字符串的子序列。

若两字符串相同，那么任一字符串的子序列均会出现在两个字符串中，此时应返回 −1



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        if (a.equals(b)) {
            return -1;
        }
        return Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
    }
}
```
