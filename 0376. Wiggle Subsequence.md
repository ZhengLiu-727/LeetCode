A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

- For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
- In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of* `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

> **思路**

动态规划的思路，和股票题有点像

`dp[i][0]`是从 0 到 i 波动序列的最大值，要求最后一下是下降的，也就是 i - 1 要大于 i

`dp[i][1]`是从 0 到 i 波动序列的最大值，要求最后一下是上升的，也就是 i - 1 要小于 i

遍历数组，根据当前数字和上一个数字的差值，更新`dp[i][0]` 或者 `dp[i][1]`，他们的更新都是基于彼此的，最后取二者最大值即可

下面的解法对动态规划进行了优化，节约了空间

> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 2) {
            return n;
        }
        int up = 1;
        int down = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up = down + 1;
            }
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down = up + 1;
            }
        }
        return Math.max(up, down);
    }
}
```
