You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`



> **思路**

和求斐波那契数列几乎一样，`f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int a = 1, b = 2, sum;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            sum = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = sum;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

**时间复杂度：** $ O( N ) $

**空间复杂度：** $ O(1) $
