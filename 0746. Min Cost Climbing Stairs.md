You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

 

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`



> **思路**

动态规划，设`dp[i]`为从i位置跳跃最少的花费，`dp[i]= cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])`

最终能跳上终点的只有倒数两个位置，（倒数第二个跳两步，倒数第一个一步两步都可以），取一个较小值即可



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = cost[0];
        dp[1] = cost[1];
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = cost[i] + Math.min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]);
        }
        return Math.min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2]);
    }
}
```
