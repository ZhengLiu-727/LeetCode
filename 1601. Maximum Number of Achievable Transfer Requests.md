We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.

**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return *the maximum number of achievable requests*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move1.jpg)

```java
Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg)

```java
Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 3
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests. 
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
- `requests[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= fromi, toi < n`



> **思路**

暴力法

为了方便，我们令 requests 的长度为 m。

数据范围很小，n 的范围为 20，而 m 的范围为 16。

根据每个 requests[i]是否选择与否，共有 2^m 种状态（不超过 70000 种状态）。我们可以采用「二进制枚举」的思路来求解，使用二进制数 state 来表示对 requests[i] 的选择情况，当 state 的第 k 位为 1，代表 requests[k] 被选择。

我们枚举所有的 state 并进行合法性检查，从中选择出包含请求数的最多（二进制表示中包含 1 个数最多）的合法 state，其包含的请求数量即是答案。

其中统计 state 中 1 的个数可以使用 lowbit，复杂度为O(m)，判断合法性则直接模拟即可（统计每座建筑的进出数量，最后判定进出数不相等的建筑数量是为 0），复杂度为 O(m)，整体计算量为不超过 2*10^6，可以过



> **解法**

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] rs;
    public int maximumRequests(int n, int[][] requests) {
        rs = requests;
        int m = rs.length, ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << m); i++) {
            int cnt = getCnt(i);
            if (cnt <= ans) continue;
            if (check(i)) ans = cnt;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    boolean check(int s) {
        int[] cnt = new int[20];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
            if (((s >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                int a = rs[i][0], b = rs[i][1];
                if (++cnt[a] == 1) sum++;
                if (--cnt[b] == 0) sum--;
            }
        }
        return sum == 0;
    }
    int getCnt(int s) {
        int ans = 0;
        while (s > 0) {
            s = s & (s-1);
            ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
